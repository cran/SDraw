\title{Prime numbers}
\usage{
primes(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number prime numbers requested, starting at 2.
Maximum is 1e8 or 100,000,000.}
}
\value{
A vector of length \code{n} containing prime numbers, in order, 
starting at 2.  Note that 1 is prime, but is never included here. I.e., 
\code{primes(1)} equals \code{c(2)}.
}
\description{
Returns the first \code{n} prime numbers (starting at 2)
}
\details{
This routine is brute-force and works well for the low primes, i.e., 
for \code{n} less than a couple hundred thousand.  It is not particularly 
efficient for large \code{n}. For example, \code{primes(2000)} on a 
Windows laptop takes approximately 4 seconds, 
while \code{primes(5000)} takes approximately 30 seconds.
}
\examples{
primes(4) #  c(2,3,5,7)    

# Prime pairs in the first 100
p <- primes(100)
p.diff <- diff(p)
cbind(p[-length(p)][p.diff==2], p[-1][p.diff==2])
