\title{Draw a Simple Systematic Sample (SSS) from a point resource or finite population frame.}
\usage{
sss.point(x, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{SpatialLines}, \code{SpatialLinesDataFrame}, or \code{data.frame} object.}

\item{n}{Sample size.  Number of points to draw from the set of all points
in \code{x}. If \code{n} exceeds the number of units (= number of rows in \code{data.frame(x)}), 
a census is taken (i.e., \code{x} is returned).}
}
\value{
If input \code{x} inherits from a the \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} class, a
\code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} object containing locations in the sample is returned. 
If input \code{x} is a \code{data.frame}, a \code{data.frame} is returned. 
Attributes of the returned sample points are: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{sampleID}: A unique identifier for every sample point.  
  \code{sampleID} starts with 1 at the first point and 
  increments by one for each.  
  \item If \code{x} inherits from \code{SpatialPoints}, 
  returned points have attribute \code{geometryID} -- the ID (=\code{row.names(x)}) of 
  the sampled point. 
  \item Any attributes (columns) associated with the input points (rows).
}
Additional attributes of the output object are:
\itemize{
   \item \code{frame}: Name of the input sampling frame (i.e., \code{x}).
   \item \code{frame.type}: Type of resource in sampling frame. (i.e., "point").
   \item \code{sample.type}: Type of sample drawn. (i.e., "SSS").
   \item \code{random.start}: The random start for the systematic sample.
}
Using these additional attributes, one could reconstruct the sample.
}
\description{
Draw a systematic sample from a \code{SpatialPoints*} object or a \code{data.frame}.   
\code{SpatialPoints*} objects can represent point resources in 2-dimensional space, such as towns, event locations, 
or grid cell centers.
}
\details{
The points in \code{x} are systematically sampled in the order
they appear. That is, the sampling frame (i.e., \code{data.frame(x)}) is 
\emph{not} re-ordered prior to sampling.  Each row in the frame represents 
a point or sample unit, and rows are sampled systematically starting with row 1.
To draw a systematic sample across the range of an attribute, say attribute \eqn{y}, 
sort \code{x} by \eqn{y} prior to calling this routine (e.g,. \code{sss.point( x[order(x$y),], n )}). 


This routine draws \emph{fixed size} systematic samples. Many 
systematic sampling procedure produce variable size samples. Conceptually, the sample 
procedure is:
\enumerate{ 
 \item Each sample unit (= row of sample frame) is associated with a line segment. Assuming there
are \eqn{N} units in the frame (\eqn{N} = \code{nrow(x)}), each line segment has length 
\eqn{n/N}, where \eqn{n} is the input desired sample size.  
 \item Line segments are placed end-to-end, starting at 0, in the order in which their associated
 unit appears in the frame. 
 \item To start the systematic sample, the routine choses a random number between 0 and 1. 
Let this random number be \eqn{m}.
 \item The sample units associated with the line segments containing the numbers \eqn{m + i} for 
\eqn{i} = 0,1,...,(\eqn{n-1}), are selected for the sample.       
}

\examples{

# Draw systematic sample across range of population
WA.samp <- sss.point( WA.cities[order(WA.cities$POP_2010),], 100 )   
plot( WA.cities )
points( WA.samp, col="red", pch=16 )

# Draw systematic sample from data frame
df <- data.frame( a=1:100, b=runif(100) )
samp <- sss.point( df, 5 )   

# Equivalent to simple random sample: randomly sort frame.
samp <- sss.point( df[order(df$b),], 5 )
