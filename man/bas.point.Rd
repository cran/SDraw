\title{Draws a Balanced Acceptance Sample (BAS) from a discrete resource (points).}
\usage{
bas.point(x, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A SpatialPoints or SpatialPointsDataFrame object. This object
must contain at least 1 point.}

\item{n}{Sample size.  Number of points to select from the set of points
contained in \code{x}.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} containing locations in the BAS sample, 
in BAS order.
 Attributes of the sample points are: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{sampleID}: A unique identifier for every sample point.  This 
  encodes the BAS order.  \code{return[order(return$sampleID),]} will sort the 
  returned object in BAS order.
  \item \code{geometryID}: The ID of the point in \code{x} that has been
  selected. The 
  ID of points in \code{x} are \code{row.names(x)}. 
  \item Any attributes of the original lines (in \code{x}). 
}

Additional attributes of the output object, beyond those which 
make it a \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame}, are:
\itemize{
   \item \code{frame}: Name of the input sampling frame.
   \item \code{frame.type}: Type of resource in sampling frame. (i.e., "point").
   \item \code{sample.type}: Type of sample drawn. (i.e., "BAS").
   \item \code{random.start}: The random seed of the random-start Halton sequence 
   that produced the sample.  This is a vector of length 2 whose elements are 
   random integers between 0 and \code{\link{maxU}}. 
   This routine ensures that the point
   associated with this index  
   falls inside a polygon of interest.  i.e., 
   that \code{halton(1,2,random.start)} scaled by a square bounding box
   (see attribute \code{bas.bbox} below)
   lies inside a polygon of \code{x}.  
   
   Note that \code{halton(1,2,random.start+i)}, for 
   \code{i} > 0, is not guaranteed to fall inside a polygon of \code{x}
   when scaled by \code{bas.bbox}. The sample consists of the point 
   associated with \code{random.start} and the next \code{n-1}
   Halton points in sequence that fall inside a polygon
   of \code{x}. 
   

   \item \code{bas.bbox}: The square bounding box surrounding \code{x}
   used to scale Halton points.  A scaled Halton sequence of n points
   is \code{bas.bbox[,"min"] +} \code{t(halton(n,2,random.start)) *} 
   \code{rep( max(diff(t(bas.bbox))), 2)}.

\description{
Draws a BAS sample from a \code{SpatialPoints*} object.
}
\details{
The BAS method for points computes the minimum distance between 
any two points in
\code{x} and places a small square (pixel) around each.  Size of the
square around each point is d/sqrt(2) on a side, where d is the minimum
distance between points. The BAS method for points then selects a BAS sample
from the set of polygons (i.e., squares) surrounding each point (see
\code{\link{bas.polygon}}).  The BAS method of polygons selects Halton
points until \code{n} points are located inside the squares surrounding the
points.  When a square contains a Halton point, the official sample location
is the the original point (center of the square), not the Halton point.
