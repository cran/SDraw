\title{Draws a Halton Lattice sample from a linear (line) resource .}
\usage{
hal.line(x, n, J = NULL, eta = c(1, 1), bases = c(2, 3), balance = "1D",
  frame.spacing = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A SpatialLines or SpatialLinesDataFrame object. This object must
contain at least 1 line.  If it contains more than 1 line, the HAL sample is
drawn from the union of all lines.}

\item{n}{Sample size.  Number of locations to draw from the set of all lines
contained in \code{x}.}

\item{J}{A 2X1 vector of base powers.  \code{J[1]} is for horizontal,
\code{J[2]} for vertical dimension. \code{J} determines the size and shape
of the smallest Halton boxes. There are \code{bases[1]^J[1]} vertical columns 
of Halton boxes over \code{x}'s bounding box, and \code{bases[2]^J[2]} 
horizontal rows of Halton boxes over the bounding box, for a total 
of \code{prod(bases^J)} total boxes.  The dimension of each box is 
\code{c(dx,dy)/(bases^J)}, where \code{c(dx,dy)} are the horizontal and 
vertical extents of \code{x}'s bounding box.  If \code{J=NULL} (the default),
\code{J} is chosen so that Halton boxes are as square as possible.}

\item{eta}{When \code{balance} is "2D", \code{eta} is a 2X1 vector 
specifying the number of points to add in the 
horizontal and vertical dimensions of each Halton box.  e.g., if 
\code{eta} = c(3,2), a grid of 3 (horizontal) by 2 (vertical) points is 
added inside each Halton box. Size and shape of Halton boxes is controlled 
by \code{J} parameter.}

\item{bases}{If \code{balance == "2D"}, this is a 2X1 vector of co-prime Halton bases.
If \code{balance == "1D"}, this is the single (scalar) Halton base to use.  
If \code{length(bases) == 2} and \code{balance == "1D"}, the first element of 
\code{bases} is used.}

\item{balance}{Option specifying how spatial balance is maintained. The options
are "1D" or "2D".  

Under "1D" all lines in \code{x} are stretched straight 
and laid end-to-end in the order the appear in \code{x} and a 1-dimensional 
BAS sample is taken from the amalgamated line.  Sample locations are then 
mapped back to two dimensional space and appear on the original lines.  This
method maintains 1D spatial balance, but not 2D balance.  Spatially 
balanced samples in 1D may not look spatially balanced when plotted 
in 2 dimensions.   

Under "2D" a systematic sample of points along the union of all lines 
in \code{x} is drawn first, and a 2-dimensional BAS sample of the points
is drawn (see \code{\link{bas.point}}).  This maintains 2D spatial 
balance of sample locations on the lines, but is slower than "1D".}

\item{frame.spacing}{If \code{balance == "2D"}, this is the desired spacing of 
points on lines prior to sampling via
HAL.  If \code{balance == "2D"}, the first step is discretization of lines by 
placing 
equally-spaced points on all lines. Then, points are sampled using Halton sampling
(see \code{hal.point}) for points.  This parameter controls spacing of points during the
discretization of lines.  For example, specifying 50, and assuming
\code{x} is projected to UTM meters, means points will be placed every 50
meters along all lines in \code{x} before sampling. \code{x} should be projected before
sampling so that \code{pt.spacing} makes sense.  If \code{pt.spacing} is not
specified and \code{balance == "2D"}, 1000*\code{n} points will be placed along 
all lines during
discretization.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} containing locations in the HAL sample, 
in HAL order.
 Attributes of the sample points are: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{sampleID}: A unique identifier for every sample point.  This 
  encodes the HAL order.  \code{return[order(return$sampleID),]} will sort the 
  returned object in HAL order. \code{sampleID}'s, in the HAL case, are not 
  consecutive. \code{sampleID}'s are usually the Halton 
  indices for the Halton boxes 
  containing the point, after adding random cycles for multiple points in 
  the same box (see \code{\link{halton.frame}}). If the sample 
  cycled around
  to the beginning of the frame, because random start 
  fell at the end, the sample number is appended 
  to the beginning of the normal \code{sampleID}'s so they
  will sort the frame in the proper order.
  
  
  \item \code{geometryID}: The ID of the line in \code{x} on which each 
  sample point falls.  The 
  ID of lines in \code{x} are \code{row.names(x)}. 
  \item Any attributes of the original lines (in \code{x}). 
}

Additional attributes of the output object, beyond those which 
make it a \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame}, are:
\itemize{
   \item \code{frame}: Name of the input sampling frame.
   \item \code{frame.type}: Type of resource in sampling frame. (i.e., "line").
   \item \code{sample.type}: Type of sample drawn. (i.e., "BAS").
   \item \code{balance}: The type of balance ("1d" or "2d").
   \item \code{random.start}: The random seed for the random-start 
   1D or 2D Halton sequence 
   that produced the sample.  
   If \code{balance=="1D"}, 
   \item \code{random.start}: The random start of the sample in the 
   1D or 2D Halton
   frame.  The Halton frame is a list of all points sorted in 
   Halton order.  Halton order is the Halton index of each point, with 
   random cycles added to multiple points 
   in the same Halton box.  If \code{balance=="2D"},
   this is a random number between 0 and the number of points 
   in the discretization of \code{x} (see \code{frame.spacing}).
   If \code{balance=="1D"}, this is a random number between 0 
   and the number of points in the 1D Halton lattice 
   discretization of \code{x} (see parameters \code{J} and \code{eta}).
   The sample consists of the 
   \code{n} consecutive units starting at \code{random.start+1} in 
   the sorted Halton frame.

\description{
Draws a Halton Lattice sample from a \code{SpatialLines*} object.
}
\details{
A HAL sample is drawn from the union of all lines in \code{x} by 
discretization of lines using points spaced \code{pt.spacing} apart. The
discretized points are then sampled using the HAL method
for points (see \code{\link{hal.point}}).

\examples{

# Default sample of Hawaii coastline. 1D balance
samp <- hal.line( HI.coast, 100 )

   
# Desire frame with spacing = 500 meters
# Frame has ~3144 points = lineLength(HI.coast)/500 
samp <- hal.line( HI.coast, 100, balance="2D", frame.spacing=500)
  
# Desire 2000 points in frame
# Set frame.spacing = lineLength / 2000 
# Set Halton lattice to contain  
#    2592 boxes = prod(c(2,3)^c(5,4))  
samp <- hal.line( HI.coast, 100, J=c(5,4), balance="2D", 
   frame.spacing=lineLength(HI.coast)/2000)
