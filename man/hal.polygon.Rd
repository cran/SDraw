\title{Draws a Halton Lattice sample from an area (polygon) resource.}
\usage{
hal.polygon(x, n, J = NULL, eta = c(1, 1), triangular = FALSE,
  bases = c(2, 3), init.n.factor = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{SpatialPoints} or \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} object. 
This object must contain at least 1 polygon.}

\item{n}{Sample size.  Number of locations to draw from the union of all 
polygons contained in \code{x}.}

\item{J}{A 2X1 vector of base powers.  \code{J[1]} is for horizontal,
\code{J[2]} for vertical dimension. \code{J} determines the size and shape
of the smallest Halton boxes. There are \code{bases[1]^J[1]} vertical columns 
of Halton boxes over \code{x}'s bounding box, and \code{bases[2]^J[2]} 
horizontal rows of Halton boxes over the bounding box, for a total 
of \code{prod(bases^J)} total boxes.  The dimension of each box is 
\code{c(dx,dy)/(bases^J)}, where \code{c(dx,dy)} are the horizontal and 
vertical extents of \code{x}'s bounding box.  If \code{J=NULL} (the default),
\code{J} is chosen so that approximately \code{1000*n} Halton boxes are placed 
in the bounding box of polygons, each as 
square as possible and each containing one point,}

\item{eta}{A 2X1 vector specifying the number of points to add in the 
horizontal and vertical dimensions of each Halton box.  e.g., if 
\code{eta} = c(3,2), a grid of 3 (horizontal) by 2 (vertical) points is 
added inside each Halton box.}

\item{triangular}{A boolean scalar. If TRUE, odd horizontal rows of the 
Halton lattice are moved one-quarter a Halton box width to the right, while 
even rows of the Halton lattice are moved one-quarter of a Halton box width 
to the left. This creates a triangular Halton lattice over the 
bounding box of the polygons. 
If FALSE, a rectangular Halton lattice is constructed.}

\item{bases}{2X1 vector of Halton bases.  These must be co-prime.}

\item{init.n.factor}{A
scalar factor controlling the approximate number of points 
in the Halton lattice to place inside the polygons before sampling. 
If \code{J} is not specified, approximately \code{init.n.factor*n} 
points are placed in the Halton lattice overlaid on the polygons 
of \code{x}.  Points in the Halton lattice are then sampled 
using the HAL method for points.  \code{init.n.factor*n} is the 
approximate frame size.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} containing locations in the HAL sample, 
in HAL order.
 Attributes of the sample points are: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{sampleID}: A unique identifier for every sample point.  This 
  encodes the HAL order.  \code{return[order(return$sampleID),]} will sort the 
  returned object in HAL order.
  
  \item \code{HaltonIndex}: The index of the Halton box containing the point. 
  This column is not, in general, unique.  Points with the same \code{HaltonIndex}
  are in the same Halton box, and are "close" in space.
  
  \item \code{geometryID}: The ID of the polygon in \code{x} containing each 
  sample point.  The 
  ID of polygons in \code{x} are \code{row.names(geometry(x))}. 
  \item Any attributes of the original polygons (in \code{x}). 
}

Additional attributes of the output object, beyond those which 
make it a \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame}, are:
\itemize{
   \item \code{frame}: Name of the input sampling frame.
   
   \item \code{frame.type}: Type of resource in sampling frame. (i.e., "polygon").
   
   \item \code{sample.type}: Type of sample drawn. (i.e., "HAL").
   
   \item \code{J}: Exponents of the bases used to form the lattice of 
   Halton boxes. This is either the input \code{J}, or the \code{J} vector
   computed by \code{\link{halton.lattice}}.  
   
   \item \code{bases}: Bases of the Halton sequence used to draw the sample. 
   
   \item \code{eta}: the \code{eta} vector used in the lattice.
   
   \item \code{hl.box}: The bounding box around points in \code{x} used to 
   draw the sample.  See \code{\link{halton.indices}}.
   
   \item \code{triangular}: Whether the underlying lattice is triangular or square.
           
   \item \code{random.start}: The random seed of the Halton lattice sample.  
   See \code{\link{hal.point}}.

\details{
\bold{A brief description of Halton Lattice sampling for polygons:} 
Given a set of Halton Lattice parameters \code{J}, \code{bases}, \code{eta}, 
and  \code{triangular}, the bounding box around all polygons is partitioned using  
a Halton lattice of \code{prod(bases^J)} boxes, each containing  \code{prod(eta)}
points. Points not inside at 
least one polygon are
dropped. All this is done by \code{\link{halton.lattice.polygon}}.  
The resulting points (the Halton lattice frame) are passed to \code{hal.point} 
and sampled using the HAL method for points.
}
\note{
The number of points in the Halton lattice becomes large very quickly. 
The number of points in the Halton lattice is \code{prod(bases^J)*prod(eta)}.
